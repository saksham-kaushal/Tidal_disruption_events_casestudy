	abstract = {In the past few years wide-field optical and {UV} transient surveys and X-ray telescopes have allowed us to identify a few dozen candidate tidal disruption events ({TDEs}). While in theory the physical processes in {TDEs} are ubiquitous, a few distinct classes of {TDEs} have been observed. Some {TDEs} radiate mainly in {NUV}/optical, while others produce prominent X-rays. Moreover, relativistic jets have been observed in only a handful of {TDEs}. This diversity might be related to the details of the super-Eddington accretion and emission physics relevant to {TDE} disks. In this Letter, we utilize novel three-dimensional general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations to study the super-Eddington compact disk phase expected in {TDEs}. Consistent with previous studies, geometrically thick disks, wide-angle optically thick fast outflows, and relativistic jets are produced. The outflow density and velocity depend sensitively on the inclination angle, and hence so does the reprocessing of emission produced from the inner disk. We then use Monte Carlo radiative transfer to calculate the reprocessed spectra and find that that the observed ratio of optical to X-ray fluxes increases with increasing inclination angle. This naturally leads to a unified model for different classes of {TDEs} in which the spectral properties of the {TDE} depend mainly on the viewing angle of the observer with respect to the orientation of the disk.},

	abstract = {The majority of supermassive black holes in the Universe lie dormant and starved of fuel. These hidden beasts can be temporarily illuminated when an unlucky star passes close enough to be tidally disrupted and consumed by the black hole. Theorists first proposed in 1975 that tidal disruption events should be an inevitable consequence of supermassive black holes in galaxy nuclei and later argued that the resulting flare of radiation from the accretion of the stellar debris could be a unique signpost for the presence of a dormant black hole in the center of a normal galaxy. It was not until over two decades later that the first convincing tidal disruption event candidates emerged in the X-rays by the {ROSAT} All-Sky Survey. Since then, over a dozen total candidates have now emerged from searches across the electromagnetic spectrum, including the X-rays, the ultraviolet, and the optical. In the last couple of years, we have also witnessed a paradigm shift with the discovery of relativistic beamed emission associated with tidal disruption events. I review the census of observational candidates to date and discuss the exciting prospects for using large samples of tidal disruption events discovered with the next-generation of ground-based and space-based synoptic surveys to probe accretion disk and/or jet formation and black hole demographics.},

Some fraction of this gas is predicted to be blown away from the {BH}, producing an optically bright ﬂare of radiation. We predict the spectra and spectral evolution of tidal disruption events, focusing on the signatures produced by photoionized gas outside the photosphere of this super-Eddington outﬂow. We show that the spectrum of such an outﬂow should show absorption lines that are strongly blueshifted relative to the host galaxy, are typically very broad (0.01–0.1c) and are most prominent at ultraviolet wavelengths (e.g. C {IV}, Lyman α, O {VI}) at early times ( 1 month for a ∼106 M {BH}). There may also be optical absorption lines of hydrogen and He {II} if there is a lower velocity component to the outﬂow ( 0.01c). At later times, the outﬂow falls out of thermal equilibrium and the continuum emission likely hardens – the absorption lines will then primarily be in the soft X-rays.},

	abstract = {We have modeled the time-variable proﬁles of the H  emission line from the nonaxisymmetric disk and debris tail created in the tidal disruption of a solar-type star by a 106 M  black hole. Two tidal disruption events were simulated using a three-dimensional relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics code to describe the early evolution of the debris during the ﬁrst 50–90 days. We have calculated the physical conditions and radiative processes in the debris using the photoionization code {CLOUDY}. We model the emission-line proﬁles in the period immediately after the accretion rate onto the black hole became signiﬁcant. We ﬁnd that the line proﬁles at these very early stages of the evolution of the postdisruption debris do not resemble the double-peaked proﬁles expected from a rotating disk, since the debris has not yet settled into such a stable structure. As a result of the uneven distribution of the debris and the existence of a ‘‘tidal tail’’ (the stream of returning debris), the line proﬁles depend sensitively on the orientation of the tail relative to the line of sight. Moreover, the predicted line proﬁles vary on fairly short timescales (of the order of hours to days). Given the accretion rate onto the black hole, we also model the H  light curve from the debris and the evolution of the H  line proﬁles in time.},

	abstract = {Tidal disruption of main-sequence stars by black holes has generally been thought to lead to a signal dominated by {UV} emission. If, however, the black hole spins rapidly and the poloidal magnetic ﬁeld intensity on the black hole horizon is comparable to the inner accretion disk pressure, a powerful jet may form whose luminosity can easily exceed the thermal {UV} luminosity. When the jet beam points at Earth, its non-thermal luminosity can dominate the emitted spectrum. The thermal and non-thermal components decay differently with time. In particular, the thermal emission should remain roughly constant for a signiﬁcant time after the period of maximum accretion, beginning to diminish only after a delay, whereas after the peak accretion rate, the non-thermal jet emission decays, but then reaches a plateau. Both transitions are tied to a characteristic timescale {tEdd} at which the accretion rate falls below Eddington. Making use of this timescale in a new parameter-inference formalism for tidal disruption events with signiﬁcant emission from a jet, we analyze the recent ﬂare source Swift J2058. It is consistent with an event in which a main-sequence solar-type star is disrupted by a black hole of mass ∼ 4 × 107 M . The beginning of the ﬂat phase in the non-thermal emission from this source can possibly be seen in the late-time light curve. Optical photometry over the ﬁrst 40 days of this ﬂare is also consistent with this picture, but is only weakly constraining because the bolometric correction is very uncertain. We suggest that future searches for main-sequence tidal disruptions use methods sensitive to jet radiation as well as to thermal {UV} radiation.},

The diﬀuse neutrino ﬂux expected from these tidal disruption events ({TDEs}) is calculated both analytically and numerically, taking account the dependence of the rate of {TDEs} on the redshift and black hole mass. We ﬁnd that ∼ 10\% of the observed diﬀuse ﬂux at {IceCube} at an energy of about 1 {PeV} can come from {TDEs} if the characteristics of known jetted tidal disruption events are assumed to apply to the whole population of these sources. If, however, plausible scalings of the jet Lorentz factor or variability timescale with the black hole mass are taken into account, the contribution of the lowest mass black holes to the neutrino ﬂux is enhanced. In this case, {TDEs} can account for most of the neutrino ﬂux detected at {IceCube}, describing both the neutrino ﬂux normalization and spectral shape with moderate baryonic loadings. While the uncertainties on our assumptions are large, a possible signature of {TDEs} as the origin of the {IceCube} signal is the transition of the ﬂux ﬂavor composition from a pion beam to a muon damped source at the highest energies, which will also result in a suppression of Glashow resonance events.},

Modeling of the broadband emission suggests the presence of a powerful relativistic jet, which contributes dominantly to the observed X-ray emission. Here we suggest that protons can be accelerated to ultra-high energies by internal shocks occurring in the jets, but their flux is insufficient to account for the observed flux of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. High energy protons can produce {\textasciitilde}0.1-10 {PeV} neutrinos through photomeson interactions with X-ray photons. The large X-ray fluence (7x10{\textasciicircum}-4 erg cm{\textasciicircum}-2) and high photopion efficiency, together with the insignificant cooling of secondary mesons, result in bright neutrino emission expected from Sw J1644+57 if the jet composition is matter-dominated. One to several neutrinos may be detected by a Km{\textasciicircum}3-scale detector from one tidal disruption event similar to Sw J1644+57, thereby providing a powerful probe of the composition of the jets.},

	abstract = {Tidal disruption events ({TDEs}) by supermassive or intermediate mass black holes have been suggested as candidate sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays ({UHECRs}) and high-energy neutrinos. Motivated by the recent measurements from the Pierre Auger Observatory, which indicates a metal-rich cosmic-ray composition at ultrahigh energies, we investigate the fate of {UHECR} nuclei loaded in {TDE} jets. First, we consider the production and survival of {UHECR} nuclei at internal shocks, external forward and reverse shocks, and nonrelativistic winds. Based on the observations of Swift J1644+57, we show that the {UHECRs} can survive for external reverse and forward shocks, and disk winds. On the other hand, {UHECR} nuclei are significantly disintegrated in internal shocks, although they could survive for low-luminosity {TDE} jets. Assuming that {UHECR} nuclei can survive, we consider implications of different composition models of {TDEs}. We find that the tidal disruption of main sequence stars or carbon-oxygen white dwarfs does not successfully reproduce {UHECR} observations, namely the observed composition or spectrum. The observed mean depth of the shower maximum and its deviation could be explained by oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarfs, but they may be too rare to be the sources of {UHECRs}.},

Further, Swift has made important contributions in providing well-covered lightcurves of {TDEs} discovered with other instruments, setting constraints on the physics that govern the {TDE} evolution, and including the discovery of the ﬁrst candidate binary {SMBH} identiﬁed from a {TDE} lightcurve.},

	abstract = {A star that wanders too close to a massive black hole ({BH}) is shredded by the {BH}’s tidal gravity. Stellar gas falls back to the {BH} at a rate initially exceeding the Eddington rate, releasing a ﬂare of energy. In anticipation of upcoming transient surveys, we predict the light curves and spectra of tidal ﬂares as a function of time, highlighting the unique signatures of tidal ﬂares at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. A reasonable fraction of the gas initially bound to the {BH} is likely blown away when the fallback rate is super-Eddington at early times. This outﬂow produces an optical luminosity comparable to that of a supernova; such events have durations of ∼10 d and may have been missed in supernova searches that exclude the nuclear regions of galaxies. When the fallback rate subsides below Eddington, the gas accretes onto the {BH} via a thin disc whose emission peaks in the ultraviolet to soft X-rays. Some of this emission is reprocessed by the unbound stellar debris, producing a spectrum of very broad emission lines (with no corresponding narrow forbidden lines). These lines are the strongest for {BHs} with {MBH} ∼ 105–106 M and thus optical surveys are particularly sensitive to the lowest mass {BHs} in galactic nuclei. Calibrating our models to {ROSAT} and Galaxy Evolution Explorer ({GALEX}) observations, we predict detection rates for Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-{STARRS}), the Palomar Transient Factory ({PTF}) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope ({LSST}) and highlight some of the observational challenges associated with studying tidal disruption events in the optical. Upcoming surveys such as {PanSTARRS} should detect at least several events per year, and may detect many more if current models of outﬂows during super-Eddington accretion are reasonably accurate. These surveys will signiﬁcantly improve our knowledge of stellar dynamics in galactic nuclei, the physics of super-Eddington accretion, the demography of intermediate mass {BHs} and the role of tidal disruption in the growth of massive {BHs}.},

	abstract = {The black hole of an active galactic nucleus is encircled by an accretion disk. The surface density of the disk is always too low to affect the tidal disruption of a star, but it can be high enough that a vigorous interaction results when the debris stream returns to pericenter and punches through the disk. Shocks excited in the disk dissipate the kinetic energy of the disk interior to the impact point and expedite inflow toward the black hole. Radiatively efficient disks with luminosity Eddington have a high enough surface density that the initial stream–disk interaction leads to energy dissipation at a super-Eddington rate. Because of the rapid inflow, only part of this dissipated energy emerges as radiation, while the rest is advected into the black hole. Dissipation, inflow, and cooling balance to keep the bolometric luminosity at an Eddington-level plateau whose duration is tens of days, with an almost linear dependence on stellar mass. After the plateau, the luminosity decreases in proportion to the disk surface density, with a power-law index between −3 and −2 at earlier times, and possibly a steeper index at later times.},

Using fully general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations and {MESA}-model initial conditions, we explore the pericenter-dependence of tidal disruption properties for eight stellar masses () and six black hole masses (). We present here the results most relevant to observations. The effects of internal stellar structure and relativity decouple for both the disruption cross section and the characteristic energy width of the debris. Moreover, the full disruption cross section is almost independent of M⋆ for M⋆/M⊙ ≲ 3. Independent of M⋆, relativistic effects increase the critical pericenter distance for full disruption events by up to a factor of ∼3 relative to the Newtonian prediction. The probability of a direct capture is also independent of M⋆; at {MBH}/M⊙ ≃ 5 × 106 this probability is equal to the probability of a complete disruption. The breadth of the debris energy distribution ΔE can differ from the standard estimate by factors of 0.35 − 2, depending on M⋆ and {MBH}, implying a corresponding change (∝(ΔE)−3/2) in the characteristic mass-return timescale. We provide analytic forms, suitable for use in both event rate estimates and parameter inference, to describe all these trends. For partial disruptions, we find a nearly universal relation between the star’s angular momentum and the fraction of M⋆ remaining. Within the “empty loss-cone” regime, partial disruptions must precede full disruptions. These partial disruptions can drastically affect the rate and appearance of subsequent total disruptions.},

In the first paper, we gave an overview of this program and discussed the principal observational implications of our work. Here we describe our calculational method, which includes a new method for calculating fully relativistic stellar self-gravity, and provide details about the outcomes of full disruptions, focusing on the stellar mass dependence of the outcomes for a black hole of mass 106 M⊙. We consider eight different stellar masses, from 0.15 M⊙ to 10 M⊙. We find that, relative to the traditional order-of-magnitude estimate rt, the physical tidal radius of low-mass stars (M⋆ ≲ 0.7 M⊙) is larger by tens of percent, while for high-mass stars (M⋆ ≳ 1 M⊙) it is smaller by a factor of 2–2.5. The traditional estimate of the range of energies found in the debris is ≈1.4× too large for low-mass stars, but is a factor of ∼2 too small for high-mass stars; in addition, the energy distribution for high-mass stars has significant wings. For all stars undergoing tidal encounters, we find that mass loss continues for many stellar vibration times because the black hole's tidal gravity competes with the instantaneous stellar gravity at the star's surface until the star has reached a distance from the black hole ∼O(10)rt.},

We provide approximate formulae that express the relativistic corrections of both and the energy width relative to their Newtonian approximate estimates. For partial disruptions, we find that the fractional remnant mass for a given ratio of the pericenter to is higher for larger {MBH}. These results have several implications. As {MBH} increases above , the cross section for complete disruptions is suppressed by competition with direct capture. However, the cross-section ratio for partial to complete disruptions depends only weakly on {MBH}. The relativistic correction to the debris energy width delays the time of peak mass-return rate and diminishes the magnitude of the peak return rate.

As a result, the mass fallback rate can deviate substantially from a t−5/3 power law, becoming more like a single peak with a tail declining as t−p with p ≃ 2–5. Surviving remnants are spun-up in the prograde direction and are hotter than main-sequence stars of the same mass. Their specific orbital energy is ≃10−3× that of the debris, but of either sign with respect to the black hole potential, while their specific angular momentum is close to that of the original star. Even for strong encounters, remnants have speeds at infinity relative to the black hole potential ≲300 km s−1, so they are unable to travel far out into the galactic bulge. The remnants most deeply bound to the black hole go through a second tidal disruption event upon their first return to pericenter; if they have not thermally relaxed, they will be completely disrupted.},

	abstract = {Tidal disruption events ({TDEs}) are generally imagined as the complete disruption of a star when it passes close to a supermassive black hole ({SMBH}). Relativistic apsidal precession is thought to quickly “circularize” the bound debris, forming a compact accretion disk, which then emits a flare of standardized light curve and spectrum. We show here that this picture holds in only a minority of cases. {TDEs} are more diverse and can be grouped into several categories distinguished by stellar pericenter distance rp; we estimate the relative frequency of these categories. Rapid circularization is rare both because it requires () and because most events with lead to direct capture. For larger pericenter distances, (for {MBH} = 106 M⊙), main-sequence stars with M* ≲ 3 are completely disrupted, but the bound debris orbits are highly eccentric and possess semimajor axes ∼100× the scale of the expected compact disk. Partial disruptions with fractional mass loss ≳10\% occur with a rate similar to that of total disruptions; for fractional mass loss ≳50\%, the rate is ≈1/3 as large. Partial disruptions—which must precede total disruptions when the stars’ angular momenta evolve in the “empty loss-cone” regime—change the orbital energy by factors ≳O(1). Partial disruption remnants are in general far from thermal equilibrium. Depending on its orbital energy and conditions within the stellar cluster surrounding the {SMBH}, a remnant may return after ∼O(100)–O(1000) yr and be fully disrupted, or it may rejoin the stellar cluster.},

We present a simple analytic model relating the light curve to the internal density structure of the star. We thus show that the standard light curve proportional to t−5/3 only holds at late times. Close to the peak luminosity the light curve is shallower, deviating more strongly from t−5/3 for more centrally concentrated (e.g. solar type) stars. We test our model numerically by simulating the tidal disruption of several stellar models, described by simple polytropic spheres with index γ. The simulations agree with the analytical model given two considerations. First, the stars are somewhat inflated on reaching pericentre because of the effective reduction of gravity in the tidal field of the black hole. This is well described by a homologous expansion by a factor which becomes smaller as the polytropic index becomes larger. Secondly, for large polytropic indices wings appear in the tails of the energy distribution, indicating that some material is pushed further away from parabolic orbits by shocks in the tidal tails. In all our simulations, the t−5/3 light curve is achieved only at late stages. In particular, we predict that for solar-type stars, this happens only after the luminosity has dropped by at least 2 mag from the peak. We discuss our results in the light of recent observations of flares in otherwise quiescent galaxies and note the dependence of these results on further parameters, such as the star/hole mass ratio and the stellar orbit.},

About half the star’s matter is given elliptical trajectories with large apocenter distances, and the other half is unbound. To form an accretion flow, the bound matter must lose a significant amount of energy, with the actual amount depending on the characteristic scale of the flow measured in units of the black hole’s gravitational radius ( erg). Recent numerical simulations have revealed that the accretion flow scale is close to the scale of the most bound initial orbits, cm from the black hole, and the corresponding energy dissipation rate is erg s−1. We suggest that the energy liberated during the formation of the accretion disk, rather than the energy liberated by subsequent accretion onto the black hole, powers the observed optical {TDE} candidates. The observed rise times, luminosities, temperatures, emission radii, and line widths seen in these {TDEs} are all more readily explained in terms of heating associated with disk formation rather than in terms of accretion.},

Combining a relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of the stellar disruption with a relativistic hydrodynamics simulation of the subsequent debris motion, we track the evolution of such a system until 80\% of the stellar mass bound to the black hole has settled into an accretion ﬂow. Shocks near the stellar pericenter and also near the apocenter of the most tightly bound debris dissipate orbital energy, but only enough to make its characteristic radius comparable to the semimajor axis of the mostbound material, not the tidal radius as previously envisioned. The outer shocks are caused by post-Newtonian relativistic effects, both on the stellar orbit during its disruption and on the tidal forces. Accumulation of mass into the accretion ﬂow is both non-monotonic and slow, requiring several to 10 times the orbital period of the most tightly bound tidal streams, while the inﬂow time for most of the mass may be comparable to or longer than the mass accumulation time. Deﬂection by shocks does, however, cause some mass to lose both angular momentum and energy, permitting it to move inward even before most of the mass is accumulated into the accretion ﬂow. Although the accretion rate still rises sharply and then decays roughly as a powerlaw, its maximum is 0.1´ the previous expectation, and the timescale of the peak is 5´ longer than previously predicted. The geometric mean of the black hole mass and stellar mass inferred from a measured event timescale is therefore 0.2´ the value given by classical theory.},

	abstract = {Unambiguous detection of the tidal disruption of a star would allow an assessment of the presence and masses of supermassive black holes in quiescent galaxies. It would also provide invaluable information on bulge-scale stellar processes (such as two-body relaxation) via the rate at which stars are injected into the tidal sphere of inﬂuence of the black holes. This rate, in turn, is essential to predict gravitational radiation emission by compact object inspirals. The signature of a tidal disruption event is thought to be a fallback rate for the stellar debris on to the black hole that decreases as t−5/3. This mass ﬂux is often assumed to yield a luminous signal that decreases in time at the same rate. In this paper, we calculate the monochromatic light curves arising from such an accretion event. Differently from previous studies, we adopt a more realistic description of the fallback rate and of the super-Eddington accretion physics. We also provide simultaneous light curves in optical, ultraviolet ({UV}) and X-rays. We show that, after a few months, optical and {UV} light curves scale as t−5/12, and are thus substantially ﬂatter than the t−5/3 behaviour, which is a prerogative of the bolometric light curve, only. At earlier times and for black hole masses {\textless}107 M , the wind emission dominates: after reaching a peak of 1041–1043 erg s−1 at roughly a month, the light curve decreases steeply as ∼t−2.6, until the disc contribution takes over. The X-ray band, instead, is the best place to detect the t−5/3 ‘smoking gun’ behaviour, although it is displayed only for roughly a year, before the emission steepens exponentially.},

The largest uncertainty arises due to the poorly constrained occupation fraction of {SMBHs} in low-mass galaxies, which otherwise dominate the total {TDE} rate. The detection rate of {TDE} ﬂares by optical surveys is calculated as a function of {SMBH} mass and other observables for several physically motivated models of {TDE} emission. We also quantify the fraction of galaxies that produce deeply penetrating disruption events. If the majority of the detected events are characterized by super-Eddington luminosities (such as disc winds, or synchrotron radiation from an off-axis relativistic jet), then the measured {SMBH} mass distribution will tightly constrain the low-end {SMBH} occupation fraction. If Eddington-limited emission channels dominate, however, then the occupation fraction sensitivity is much less pronounced in a ﬂux-limited survey (although still present in a volume-complete event sample). The {SMBH} mass distribution of the current sample of {TDEs}, though highly inhomogeneous and encumbered by selection effects, already suggests that Eddington-limited emission channels dominate. Even our most conservative rate estimates appear to be in tension with much lower observationally inferred {TDE} rates, and we discuss several possible resolutions to this discrepancy.},

	abstract = {When a star comes too close to a supermassive black hole, it gets torn apart by strong tidal forces in a tidal disruption event, or {TDE}. Half of the elongated stream of debris comes back to the stellar pericenter where relativistic apsidal precession induces a self-crossing shock. As a result, the gas gets launched into an outflow that can experience additional interactions, leading to the formation of an accretion disc. We carry out the first radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of this process, making use of the same injection procedure to treat the self-crossing shock as in our previous adiabatic study. Two sets of realistic parameters of the problem are considered that correspond to different strengths of this initial interaction. In both cases, we find that the injected matter has its trajectories promptly circularized by secondary shocks taking place near the black hole. However, the generated internal energy efficiently diffuses away in the form of radiation, which results in a thin vertical profile of the formed disc. The diffusing photons promptly irradiate the surrounding debris until they emerge with a bolometric luminosity of \$L{\textbackslash}approx 10{\textasciicircum}\{44\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm erg{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Towards the self-crossing shock, diffusion is however slowed that results in a shallower luminosity increase, with a potentially significant component in the optical band. Matter launched to large distances continuously gains energy through radiation pressure, which can cause a significant fraction to become unbound. This work provides direct insight into the origin of the early emission from {TDEs}, which is accessed by a rapidly increasing number of observations.},

Following this encounter, the debris evolves into an elongated stream, half of which coming back to pericentre. Relativistic apsidal precession then leads to a self-crossing shock that initiates the formation of an accretion disc. We perform the first simulation of this process considering a parabolic encounter with a supermassive black hole, which has so far eluded investigations for computational reasons. This numerical issue is alleviated by using as initial conditions the outflow launched by the self-crossing shock according the local simulation of Lu \&amp; Bonnerot (2020). We find that the gas leaving the intersection point experiences numerous secondary shocks that result in the rapid formation of a thick and marginally bound disc. The mass distribution features two overdensities identified as spiral shocks that drive slow gas inflow along the mid-plane. Inward motion primarily takes place along the funnels of the newly formed torus, from which a fraction of the matter can get accreted. Further out, the gas moves outward forming an extended envelope completely surrounding the accretion flow. Secondary shocks heat the debris at a rate of a few times \$10{\textasciicircum}\{44\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm erg{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ with a large fraction likely participating to the bolometric luminosity.

	abstract = {The disruption of stars by supermassive black holes has been linked to more than a dozen flares in the cores of galaxies out to redshift z ∼ 0.4. Modeling these flares properly requires a prediction of the rate of mass return to the black hole after a disruption. Through hydrodynamical simulation, we show that aside from the full disruption of a solar mass star at the exact limit where the star is destroyed, the common assumptions used to estimate , the rate of mass return to the black hole, are largely invalid. While the analytical approximation to tidal disruption predicts that the least-centrally concentrated stars and the deepest encounters should have more quickly-peaked flares, we find that the most-centrally concentrated stars have the quickest-peaking flares, and the trend between the time of peak and the impact parameter for deeply penetrating encounters reverses beyond the critical distance at which the star is completely destroyed. We also show that the most-centrally concentrated stars produced a characteristic drop in shortly after peak when a star is only partially disrupted, with the power law index n being as extreme as −4 in the months immediately following the peak of a flare. Additionally, we find that n asymptotes to ≃ − 2.2 for both low- and high-mass stars for approximately half of all stellar disruptions. Both of these results are significantly steeper than the typically assumed n = −5/3. As these precipitous decay rates are only seen for events in which a stellar core survives the disruption, they can be used to determine if an observed tidal disruption flare produced a surviving remnant. We provide fitting formulae for four fundamental quantities of tidal disruption as functions of the star's distance to the black hole at pericenter and its stellar structure: the total mass lost, the time of peak, the accretion rate at peak, and the power-law index shortly after peak. These results should be taken into consideration when flares arising from tidal disruptions are modeled.},
